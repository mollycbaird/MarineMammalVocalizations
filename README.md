# MarineMammalVocalizations
Created a machine learning algorithm for classifying marine mammal vocalizations. The algorithm is based on building spectrograms of the vocalizations and utilizing the singular value decomposition to transform the data into the optimal basis for analysis. The results from using different unsupervised and supervised classifiers in the algorithm are compared. Sound clips from a number of different species of dolphins, whales, and pinnipeds (seal-like mammals) are used to evaluate the algorithm.
